Assignment 5 – Python Data Structures and Strings

In this repository, you'll find two straightforward Python scripts utilizing dictionaries and list slicing.

Task 1 – Dictionary of Student Marks

File: task1.py

The dictionary contains student names as keys and their respective marks as values.

The name of a student is provided by the user.

If the student is found, the program outputs the marks.

Otherwise, it states: "Student not found."

Task 2 – Slicing Lists

File: task2.py

A list of integers ranging from 1 to 10 is generated.

Through slicing, the first five integers are obtained.

The subsequent step is to reverse the order of these numbers.

Finally, both lists are displayed to the user.
